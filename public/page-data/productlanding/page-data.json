I wanted to mimic the apple product page and add a twist to it. Keep it clean and minimal. The focus was on applying Visual Designs with a combination of typography, color theory, graphics, animation, page layout, and to deliver my message. To apply accessibility to include people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities. Then make a responsive web design that works and looks great on all devices.","goals":"My goal for this project was to implement a sticky navbar that drops down on scroll, to make a hamburger button with JavaScript, to use CSS with variables in my stylesheet and mimic apples design. As a bonus I added an embedded youtube video that links to an apple product.","lessonsLearned":"What I learnt was how to make a sticky navbar with JavaScript after doing lots of research.
