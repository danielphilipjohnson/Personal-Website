The focus was on applying Visual Designs with a combination of typography, color theory, graphics, animation, page layout, and to deliver my message. To apply accessibility to include people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities. Then make a responsive web design that works and looks great on all devices.","goals":"I wanted to make a great form that was responsive and worked on all devices. To use both flex and grid for the layout. I used a column for layout for the main content using 1fr for mobile and for tablet and for desktop 1fr 2fr. I also wanted to style form elements and make a custom select to make it visually appealing.","lessonsLearned":"I learned that styling a custom select can create problems when using different browsers there are cross browser compatible issues. I had to put in a lot of research into browser extensions for placeholders and hiding the appearance of the select arrow. Some elements can be styled like <form> and simple <input />. However, <input type=\"search\"> is more difficult to style and some elements can't be styled thoroughly using CSS like <input type=\"file\"> . Using custom form styles that rely on JavaScript are problematic for those who don't have JavaScript running.","mobileView":"../../../images/responsive-img/survey/survey-form-mobile.png","toolUsed":[{"name":"HTML","src":"../../../images/about-logos/html5.svg","about":"HTML is a markup language that uses a special syntax or notation to describe the structure of a webpage to the browser.
