I decided to make the Recipe book look like a restaurant website where recipes can be added. The rules were simple, Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself. Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
