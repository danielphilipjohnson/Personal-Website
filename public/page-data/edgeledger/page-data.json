I wanted to refresh my front-end skills and evaluate my performance. As well as breaking the reliance on using CSS framework like Bootstrap to design the user interface. With react.js using framework is not as common.One of the projects was building Edge Ledger with flexbox. After the lessons, I took the screenshot of his website and made it my own.","goals":"I wanted to assimilate the design without looking at the source code and to make a website similar to quickbook. I decided to test my knowledge of HTML and CSS. I wanted a rapid prototype so I used fontawesome icons and unsplash for images. I created CSS variables to save the default styling of some items.I built some utility classes to speed up designing the webpage.I styled my own navbar so that the layout changes based on devices. For mobile and tablet devices I was inspired by quickbooks nav. On Desktop I wanted the navbar to stick to the top which was achieved by using js and jquery. When clicking on a navbar item the web page scrolls to that section. A little bonus I added was when clicking on the images a lightbox appears with text.","lessonsLearned":"In this project I started to test my understanding of:\n      Building with an HTML5 Semantic Layout,\n      Using CSS Fundamentals and CSS Variables,\n      Testing my Knowledge of Flexbox Layout,\n      Building Responsive Design With Media Queries, and\n      Using CSS Units - rem, em, vh, vw\n      ","mobileView":"../../../images/responsive-img/edge-ledger/edge-ledger-mobile.png","toolUsed":[{"name":"HTML","src":"../../../images/about-logos/html5.svg","about":"HTML is a markup language that uses a special syntax or notation to describe the structure of a webpage to the browser.
