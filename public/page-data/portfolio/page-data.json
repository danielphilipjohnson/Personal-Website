I used a purple, pink and blue color scheme that is similar to my twitter. The focus was on applying Visual Designs with a combination of typography, color theory, graphics, animation, page layout, and to deliver my message. To apply accessibility to include people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities. Then make a responsive web design that works and looks great on all devices.","goals":"The goal of this project was to build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNBOYG. I decided to alter the design a lot. I listed my projects in a portfolio section by making card components. I included a contact form, added a testimonial section, listed my technical skills with logos and put social icons on my jumbotron.","lessonsLearned":"There was so much custom CSS I had to resort to using a preproccesor SASS to make the CSS more modular.","mobileView":"../../../images/responsive-img/portfolio/portfolio-mobile.png","toolUsed":[{"name":"HTML","src":"../../../images/about-logos/html5.svg","about":"HTML is a markup language that uses a special syntax or notation to describe the structure of a webpage to the browser.
