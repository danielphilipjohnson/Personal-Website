I identified my weaknesses with Sass and improved upon it. I avoided style inheritance issues, specificity issues and improved computing values with REM. Encountered less responsive issues when making designs. My projects started to come to life and feel less static with animations. I now have more confidence with building animations. I started to use the NPM ecosystem more comfortably. Overall, I feel more confident in my Front-End skills and improved in areas that needed updating.\n      ","mobileView":"../../../images/sass-advanced/nexters/nexters-mobile.png","toolUsed":[{"name":"HTML","src":"../../../images/about-logos/html5.svg","about":"HTML is a markup language that uses a special syntax or notation to describe the structure of a webpage to the browser.
