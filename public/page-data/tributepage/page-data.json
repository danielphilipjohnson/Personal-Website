The focus was on applying Visual Designs with a combination of typography, color theory, graphics, animation, page layout, and to deliver my message. To apply accessibility to include people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities. Then make a responsive web design that works and looks great on all devices.\n      The first project I took was a tribute page, over time it has \n      changed from a basic design I did for Dr. Norman Borlaug to what \n      it is currently. The person I choose for my tribute page is:\n       Jarad Anthony Higgins. My reason was to highlight programs that support \n       the younger generation battling addiction, anxiety and depression. \n       To promote the younger generation to speak about their feelings openly.\n      ","goals":"I wanted the colors to reflect Juice Wrld posthumous album 'Legends Never Die'. For the website I included youtube iFrame linking to top songs from the album.Then I used spotify embed and blended them into the website. I decided to use only vanilla CSS, test my knowledge of flex and grid for the layout and to make it fully responsive on all devices. After finishing Advanced CSS and Sass course on Udemy I wanted to use basic animations to my website to make it interactive.\n      ","lessonsLearned":" In this project I started to test my understanding of Grid and Flex layout.","mobileView":"../../../images/responsive-img/tribute-page/tribute-page-mobile.png","toolUsed":[{"name":"HTML","src":"../../../images/about-logos/html5.svg","about":"HTML is a markup language that uses a special syntax or notation to describe the structure of a webpage to the browser.
