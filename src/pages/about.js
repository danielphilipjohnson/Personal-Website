              Hi, it's Daniel. I am an English front-end engineer from Truro
              Cornwall who currently works remotely for codecareer.io. I'm
              responsible for maintaining a hiring system and well as
              contributing to a job board. In my spare time, I have a series of
              react side projects and I also contribute to the community with
              React and web resources.
            </p>
            <p>
              My professional life is a summary: I graduated from the University
              of Plymouth with a BSc in psychology in 2014. It was at university
              I discovered my passion for development. I started with
              programming my own project for a neuroscience experiment and then
              onto helping others. During my neuroscience lessons, I loved the
              topic of vision and memory. It was "vision" that took a lot of my
              interest like how colours catch our eyes and how the placement of
              items has importance. Around the same time, I developed an
              interest in web development during my free time.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              After, I finished my four years of studies. I started to travel
              around the world. Deciding my next plan and my goals. It suddenly
              hit me during this period while applying for graduate psychology
              positions. I found myself spending more and more time programming
              in my spare time. Developing a strong connection. So I decided to
              start with freecodecamp. I successfully finished in 2017 and then
              progressed onto Udacity in 2018 whilst working a full-time job. I
              gained a lot of experience and confidence in web development and
              setout my targetted path. Improving areas that required attention
              and growing my connections. Recently, I successfully joined
              codecareer.io as a react developer and future content creator.{" "}

              <b>When did I discover programming:</b> Well, when I was a young
              child, my mother, in her spare time would copy code from a manual
              to make games run on the{" "}

              but putting them into memory. She kept this console for quite some
              time it was the closest thing we had to a computer. The first game
              I remember helping run was{" "}

              . It was so exciting to see it running, however, not so for my
              mom. She claimed all that time for a space invaders clone.
