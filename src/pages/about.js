                  Currently, I'm finishing off my language studies with the
                  Spanish language. I know that speaking and reading in the
                  English language is a blessing. Many people do not have access
                  to good programming content due to it being in English.
                  Providing a language barrier. Also, most educational content
                  is not reasonably priced when you convert it to other
                  currencies. For instance, Peruvian Soles to Dollars it can
                  make courses very expensive. This is something I'm serious
                  about addressing and hoping to help with. That's why I
                  volunteer my time and money to help those from South America
                  and North America. I want to also make educational content
                  that is accessible to as much of the world as possible. If you
                  would like to help by converting my future tutorials, blog and
                  books to other languages. Please let me know :). I'm happy to
                  give you credit. I hope we can all make educational content
                  more accessible to those who desire to program can do it.{" "}

                Although it seems like my life is entirely ruled by programming
                and computers. I do have spare time and things that I cherish. I
                love to read about psychology from both books and journals. I
                also love reading in general. Here are some books I've enjoyed
                reading right now.

                In another life, I was actually for a while a semi-professional
                Fortnite player. I enjoyed playing it a lot. However, after a
                while, I started to feel a great sense of unfulfillment. I
                started, to realise just because you are good at something
                doesn't necessarily mean you should force yourself to do it. I
                still prefer anonymity for the reason I never liked to disclose
                my real identity. Despite that, I still wish to try public
                speaking at conferences. Who knows what the future holds?

                During my competition days, coding made me really happy. I got
                out of bed excited and, it drives my girlfriend crazy as I
                always bother her with my projects and what I had learnt. It
                still happens now. Always she sits there and tries hard to
                understand.

                The significant part of my life and the biggest change is my
                girlfriend Fabiola. I don't want to name her fully because I
                want her to still feel some anonymity and not feel pressured.
                With her, everything started to click for me in my programming
                career. Having someone that believes your dream so much that
                even when you feel low and down afterlife beating you. She is
                there still believing in me. She keeps my life in balance by
                forcing me to take breaks when I decide to overdo it. Also
                giving me constant encouragement to be better and quick to offer
                some pointers on what needs addressing. Really we a- mover
