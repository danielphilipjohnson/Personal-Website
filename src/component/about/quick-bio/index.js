        PC to submit my assignments. So during the summer of 2008, I worked so
        hard cleaning hotels with my mother. I now had enough money to buy my
        first computer a

        broke the

        I had no clue how to fix it and no other device to search how to fix it.
        I was then forced to use the library to find a solution get a windows
        disc this seemed almost impossible. I started to ask what is Windows and
        is there an alternative. The answer was Yes!

        . I encountered problems I was unable to download the ISO. So I asked
        canonical for a disc and enclosed a cheque to cover the shipping. From
        that day I have used Linux ever since. The distros I commonly use now
        are

        as my GUI "you know what they say old habits die hard." Yes, I
        occasionally use Windows. After I built my next PC, I got

        . The idea of making games for Xbox seemed great. It gave me a moment of
        nostalgia with my mom. Which lead me to learn C# from

          Microsoft Academy

        out of interest as well as a samba server. All in my free time. During
        my final year of studies, I was responsible for creating experiments
        with python and using libraries such as
