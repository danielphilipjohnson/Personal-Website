        Although it seems like my life is entirely ruled by programming and
        computers. I do have spare time and things that I cherish. I love to
        read about psychology from both books and journals. I also love reading
        in general. Here are some books I've enjoyed reading right now.

        In another life, I was actually for a while a semi-professional Fortnite
        player. I enjoyed playing it a lot. However, after a while, I started to
        feel a great sense of unfulfillment. I started, to realise just because
        you are good at something doesn't necessarily mean you should force
        yourself to do it. I still prefer anonymity for the reason I never liked
        to disclose my real identity. Despite that, I still wish to try public
        speaking at conferences. Who knows what the future holds?

        During my competition days, coding made me really happy. I got out of
        bed excited and, it drives my girlfriend crazy as I always bother her
        with my projects and what I had learnt. It still happens now. Always she
        sits there and tries hard to understand.

        The significant part of my life and the biggest change is my girlfriend
        Fabiola. I don't want to name her fully because I want her to still feel
        some anonymity and not feel pressured. With her, everything started to
        click for me in my programming career. Having someone that believes your
        dream so much that even when you feel low and down afterlife beating
        you. She is there still believing in me. She keeps my life in balance by
        forcing me to take breaks when I decide to overdo it. Also giving me
        constant encouragement to be better and quick to offer some pointers on
        what needs addressing. Really we a- mover Banner to the Top - move
