  <b>When did I discover programming:</b> Well, when I was a young
  child, my mother, in her spare time would copy code from a
  manual to make games run on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">
    Commodore 64 (CBM 64)
  </a>
  but putting them into memory. She kept this console for quite
  some time it was the closest thing we had to a computer. The
  first game I remember helping run was <a href="https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/blue-meanies-from-outer-space/">
    Blue Meanies from Outer Space
  </a>
  . It was so exciting to see it running, however, not so for my
  mom. She claimed all that time for a space invaders clone.

  Span a few years to one year before I started college. I needed
  to buy a PC to submit my assignments. So during the summer of
  2008, I worked so hard cleaning hotels with my mother. I now had
  enough money to buy my first computer a <a href="https://www.mrmemory.co.uk/memory-ram-upgrades/packard-bell/imedia/x2414">Packard Bell iMedia
  x2414</a> with an enormous amount of Ram totalling 2GB and an intel
  Celeron with duo cores. The best part was it was running
  everyone's favourite Windows version <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista">Windows Vista</a>. It was so
  hard to get any work done. Then one fatal evening windows broke
  the <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/69029855-21c1-411d-bdd3-b864222eefb6/dhcp-on-vista-has-stopped-running?forum=itprovistasetup">DHCP no longer worked</a> I had no clue how to fix it and no
  other device to search how to fix it. I was then forced to use
  the library to find a solution get a windows disc this seemed
  almost impossible. I started to ask what is Windows and is there
  an alternative. The answer was Yes! <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JauntyJackalope">Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty
  Jackalope)</a>. I encountered problems I was unable to download the
  ISO. So I asked canonical for a disc and enclosed a cheque to
  cover the shipping. From that day I have used Linux ever since.
  The distros I commonly use now are <a href="https://kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu 20.10</a>, 
  <a href="https://manjaro.org/">Manjaro"</a> and <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch
  Linux</a>. I use <a href="https://kde.org/">KDE</a> as my GUI "you know what they say old habits
  die hard." Yes, I occasionally use Windows. After I built my
  next PC, I got <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7">Windows 7</a> and came across <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA_Game_Studio"XNA Game Studio 3.0</a>.
  The idea of making games for Xbox seemed great. It gave me a
  moment of nostalgia with my mom. Which lead me to learn C# from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/">Microsoft Academy</a> and
  eventually built an <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/xnarpgtoolkit/">RPG game from the toolkit</a> they provided. I
  progressed onto making an <a href="https://ubuntu.com/server">Ubuntu Linux server</a> out of interest as
  well as a samba server. All in my free time. During my final
  year of studies, I was responsible for creating experiments with
  python and using libraries such as <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas<a/>, <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> 
  and <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>
  to plot and analysis data. Now I found my calling with web
  development and love every moment I get using JavaScript and
  react.js`,

    to good programming content due to it being in English. Providing a language barrier. Also, most educational content is
    not reasonably priced when you convert it to other currencies. For instance, Peruvian Soles to Dollars it can make courses very
    expensive. This is something I'm serious about addressing and hoping to help with. That's why I volunteer my time and money to
    help those from South America and North America. I want to also make educational content that is accessible to as much of the
    world as possible. If you would like to help by converting my future tutorials, blog and books to other languages. Please let

    program can do it. </p>`,
