      `Hi, it's Daniel. I am an English front-end engineer from Truro
    Cornwall who currently works remotely for codecareer.io. I'm
    responsible for maintaining a hiring system and well as
    contributing to a job board. In my spare time, I have a series
    of react side projects and I also contribute to the community
    with React and web resources.`,
      `My professional life is a summary: I graduated from the
    University of Plymouth with a BSc in psychology in 2014. It was
    at university I discovered my passion for development. I started
    with programming my own project for a neuroscience experiment
    and then onto helping others. During my neuroscience lessons, I
    loved the topic of vision and memory. It was "vision" that took
    a lot of my interest like how colours catch our eyes and how the
    placement of items has importance. Around the same time, I
    developed an interest in web development during my free time.`,
      ` After, I finished my four years of studies. I started to travel
    around the world. Deciding my next plan and my goals. It
    suddenly hit me during this period while applying for graduate
    psychology positions. I found myself spending more and more time
    programming in my spare time. Developing a strong connection. So
    I decided to start with freecodecamp. I successfully finished in
    2017 and then progressed onto Udacity in 2018 whilst working a
    full-time job. I gained a lot of experience and confidence in
    web development and setout my targetted path. Improving areas
    that required attention and growing my connections. Recently, I
    successfully joined codecareer.io as a react developer and
    future content creator.`,
